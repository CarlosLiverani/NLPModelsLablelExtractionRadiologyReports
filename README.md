# NLPModelsLablelExtractionRadiologyReports
A personal project that involves using natural language processing models to extract ground truth labels from radiology reports to build a question and answering system. 

In this project we'll extract information from unstructured medical text. In particular, we'll cover the following topics:

Extracting disease labels from clinical reports
Text matching
Evaluating a labeler
Negation detection
Dependency parsing
Question Answering with BERT
Preprocessing text for input
Extracting answers from model output
This project is inspired by the work done by Irvin et al.
